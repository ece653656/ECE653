Assignment 3 Part1(D) description

The main idea of this approach is to consider the order for pipair, while discovering bug by the method of part1(A)
The only difference with Part1(A) is that HashMap ¡®location¡¯ changed from Map<Set,Set> into Map<List,Set>
The Map<List,Set> can help distinguish [A,B] from [B,A], and store pipair with same element such as [A,A]


The running mothod is the same with part1(A)
As there are no pipair to connect callgraph with java program, you can run command like this in test3 folder on eceLinux:
1 bash
2 opt -print-callgraph test3.bc 2>&1 >/dev/null  | java -cp ../ -Xms128m -Xmx128m pipair_java $@ 2>/dev/null



The bug output include:
1 the original bug in Part1(A),but have been reduce, because some false positive gereneated by MAY belief in Part1(A)
2 new bug such as 'single function should appear more than once' or 'functions should be called in proper order'
